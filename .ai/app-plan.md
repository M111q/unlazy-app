# Application Plan Summary - Unlazy app

This document summarizes the analysis of the initial application plan, outlines the revised project assumptions, and details the selected technology stack for the training session tracker application project.

## Analysis of the Initial Plan

The initial plan proposed an application designed to track user training sessions. Key functionalities outlined include user authentication (login/registration), listing user's training sessions with summary statistics (total kilograms, total repetitions), viewing detailed session information including a list of performed exercise series, and capabilities for adding, editing, and deleting both training sessions and individual series. Data entry for series and sessions is intended to be handled via modal interfaces.

Initial assumptions included presenting series within a session as a flat list, utilizing simplified pagination, and omitting filtering functionality in the initial version.

Project requirements for course completion mandate the implementation of user authentication, one function demonstrating business logic, one function demonstrating CRUD operations, inclusion of a functional test (unit or end-to-end), and configuration of a CI/CD scenario using Github Actions. A specific constraint for the project is the required use of Supabase for providing authentication services and the application database.

## Project Assumptions (Revised)

Based on the initial plan and subsequent clarifications, the following refined assumptions define the scope of the first version of the application:

*   **User Management:** The application will support user registration and login via the Supabase Auth module.
*   **Session Listing:** A view will display a paginated list of authenticated user's training sessions. Each session entry will include summary statistics: the total weight lifted (sum of kilograms across all series) and the total repetitions performed (sum of repetitions across all series) within that session.
*   **Session Details:** Selecting a session will lead to a view displaying detailed information about the session, including a flat, paginated list of associated exercise series.
*   **Session Management:** Users will be able to add new sessions, edit existing session details, and delete sessions.
*   **Series Management:** Within the session details view, users will be able to add new series, edit existing series details, and delete series. Modals will be used for data input.
*   **Series Data:** Each recorded series will consist of:
    *   An **exercise name** selected from a predefined list. Custom exercise names are not supported in this version.
    *   The **number of repetitions** performed.
    *   The **weight** used, specified in kilograms. Other weight units are not supported. Exercises without weight are not supported.
*   **User Interface:** Simplified pagination will be implemented for lists of sessions and series. Filtering capabilities will not be included in the initial version.

## Selected Technology Stack

Considering the project requirements, the need to utilize Supabase, and the developer's experience profile (Java, TypeScript, PHP; Spring Boot, Angular, Laravel, React), the following technology stack has been selected:

1.  **Database and Authentication (Auth):** **Supabase**
    *   Role: Provides a PostgreSQL database and a managed authentication service as required by the course.
    *   Benefit: Leverages a robust, scalable backend platform without requiring manual database administration or complex Auth implementation.

2.  **Frontend:** **Angular**
    *   Role: Handles the user interface and client-side logic.
    *   Benefit: Aligns with the developer's strong experience in TypeScript and Single Page Application (SPA) frameworks, enabling efficient development of the application's views, components, and modals.

3.  **Core Logic (CRUD and Business Logic):** **Angular with Supabase JS SDK**
    *   Role: Implementation of data management (CRUD operations for sessions and series) and the primary business logic function (calculation of session summary statistics).
    *   Benefit: Utilizes the official Supabase SDK within the Angular application to interact directly and securely with the Supabase database and Auth services, providing a streamlined approach for meeting core project requirements.

4.  **Optional AI Functionality:** **Supabase Edge Functions**
    *   Role: A potential platform for implementing future extensions, such as generating advanced training summaries using Large Language Models (LLMs).
    *   Benefit: Provides a serverless environment running on Deno (TypeScript/JavaScript) suitable for securely making external API calls (e.g., to LLM services) and processing data outside the frontend, integrating seamlessly with the Supabase ecosystem. This approach keeps sensitive keys off the client-side and centralizes server-side logic if needed.

This technology stack provides a solid and efficient foundation for developing the training session tracker application, leveraging existing skills while directly addressing the project's specific requirements and constraints.
